### What you like about your implementation
I enjoyed tackling the challenge of arranging items on the timeline in a compact, space-efficient way directly on screen.
It was fascinating to design and position the elements in a way that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining readability.
I also implemented an aside list to complement the timeline, and designed the layout to be mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience on smaller screens.

### What you would change if you were going to do it again
I would add drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to adjust the start and end dates of items directly on the timeline.
This would make the component more interactive and closer to a production-ready tool.

### How you made your design decisions
Yes, I look some timelines designs on Dribbble to get inspiration.
I try to make something clean and simple to use.

### How you would test this if you had more time
I would test the lanes function to be sure the items do not overlap.
Also test on mobile and other browsers.
If have more time I would make some automatic tests for components too, by using Jest, React Testing Library to make sure the component renders correctly.
